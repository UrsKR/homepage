Sweet as it may be for casual users, I find Windows to be lacking when it comes to development.  
Here are some tools that I find indispensible to work at full capacity.

Which do you like? Where am I missing out?

### System Tools
[MS SysInternals Suite Process Explorer](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653): A fully featured replacement for the built in Task Manager, this one shows processes and their dependencies, system load and even file handles.  
[Rapid Environment Editor](http://www.rapidee.com/): As it stands, the "Environment Variables" section in Windows' control panel is both well hidden and a pain to use. Enter Rapid EE - it makes editing a breeze, has auto-completion for path-like values and even checks entries for validity.  

### Everyday Tools
[Console2](http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/): Console is window dressing for Windows' command prompt. Tabs? Check. Colors? Check. Resizing? Check again. It even remembers where you want your prompt to start.  
[Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/): It's no secret that the original Notepad isn't quite up to standards. The two ++ in this tools name are just what I need.  
[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/): It's the world's most popular browser for a reason.  
[Pidgin](http://www.pidgin.im/): There are many IM clients out there. I just happen to like pidgin best.  

### Generic Developer Tools
[Putty](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) & [WinSCP](http://winscp.net/eng/index.php): There's hardly a day I don't use one of these. They do what they are built for, and they do it admirably.  
[MSysGit](http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/): Git for Windows. Of all the SCMs I have used, git feels best, and this Windows package answers all questions I might have.  

### Java Developer Tools
[IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/): I liked IDEA when I first saw its phenomenal Grails support. I started loving it when I first used it for Java development. I used [eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) for 7 years, but I never looked back.  
[JProfiler](http://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html?gclid=CKHx8_r4lLECFYEXzQoduXDPlw): Now that Java comes with a profiler of its own, JProfiler is no longer the indispensible tool it once was. Easy to use, simple to integrate and abundantly powerful, it is still the best to me.  
[Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) & [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/): While I like Gradle better by far, it pays to have both of them around if you want to have a look at the inside of open source software once in a while.

Disclosure: I have received free Open Source licenses for both JProfiler and IntelliJ IDEA.
