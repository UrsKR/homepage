I am Urs, and I live in Hamburg, Germany.  

With a background in engineering, a passion for agile methodologies, and a career dedicated to consulting, I help client leadership teams optimize their strategic decision-making, communication, and work processes.
I approach things rationally, data-driven and systems-oriented.

My interests range from the nuances of language and their implications for collaboration to the art of photography and the discipline of [Chinese martial arts](http://centre-qigong-hamburg.de). In fact, I've been teaching martial arts since 2013, an experience that has significantly shaped my understanding of leadership and strategy. I you ever are around and would like to practice together, let me know!

I'm also an avid gamer, enjoying the immersive worlds and strategic challenges of video games, as well as the camaraderie and competition of various other types of games.

Currently, I'm a partner and strategic consultant at it-agile in Hamburg, Germany, where I have the privilege of serving clients across Europe.
