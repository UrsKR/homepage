My name is Urs, and I live in Hamburg, Germany.  

An engineer by education, an agilist by conviction and a consultant by
choice, I work with clients’ leadership to improve their strategic decision
making, communication and work processes.  

I approach things rationally, data-driven and systems-oriented. My interests range from the finer points of language and their implications to photography and [chinese martial arts](http://centre-qigong-hamburg.de) – all off which have taught me useful things for leadership and strategy, as have my beautiful wife and daughter.  

Currently, I am a partner and strategic consultant at it-agile in Hamburg, Germany, serving clients all over Europe.
